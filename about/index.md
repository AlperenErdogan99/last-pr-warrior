# About


I am a software engineer in Turkey and I graduated from Electronics and Communication Engineering.

During my university education, I interested with Embedded System Programming, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I started my professional life as an Embedded Software Engineer.
I made progress in C++, OOP, Qml, Linux, Yocto Project and Git and contributed to the company I work for.
Then I started my new job as a software engineer. Nowadays, I started working on a more complex system using the topics of my previous job.
In addition, in my personal life, I work to learn about Docker, Data structures and Design Pattern.

In today, I am starting to share what I've learned on my blog. I hope it will be useful to someone.
